### Step-2- Go to [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) and create a new integration 
- Click view my integration
- Create a new integration
- Copy and store your **Internal Integration token**

### Step-3- Go to your Notion page which you duplicated in Step-1 and retrieve your *Database ID*

- Click on share button and share your page to the integration you made in step 2 

**Remember to open your page as full page and not inline database**
